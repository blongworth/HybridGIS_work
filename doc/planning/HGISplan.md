# Status update

Flow tests with glass and PEEK capillaries.

Tested for flow and discharge with various capillaries. No evidence of
discharge with pure CO2. Did not run source with beam. Looks like 2m of 75um
capillary should give good flows @ 15kPa (150mbar). 100um capillaries should
work well for lower pressures or with Helium dilution. PEEK capillaries seem
to produce lower flow rates than they should. May be getting pinched in 1/16
swage fittings.

# Next steps

Next test should probably be ion source tests with low pressure capillaries.
Should also try helium to test for discharge.

## Gas panel

* Leak check
* Test

## Helium dillution

* Order GV
* Install GV and pump
* Test using gas panel

## Open split

* Pick capillaries
* Test with bottle gas
* Test with Gasbench

## Dual Bellows

### Labview

* Controls for bellows
* Integrate bellows & valve control

### Hardware

* HV gauge
* Better mbar range gauge
* Wire bellows motors
* Tube cracker
* Cold finger
* Helium dilution


### Planning

* Initial sample size
* Best operating pressure
* Helium dilution

### Tests

* Best flow rate
* Sample size test
* Cracker test
