abstract = {The National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (NOSAMS) facility at the Woods Hole Ocean- ographic Institution has developed an automated system for high-throughput, low-cost analysis of radiocarbon in carbonate samples (e.g. corals, carbonaceous sediments, speleothems, etc.). The method bypasses graphitization and pretreatment, and reduces costs to about 1/5th the price of a graphite-based 14C carbonate analysis, with a throughput of 60 unknowns per day and an analytical precision of better than 2{\%}. Additionally, a simple mixing experiment indicated that extensive cleaning of carbonate samples to remove organic material is not necessary},
