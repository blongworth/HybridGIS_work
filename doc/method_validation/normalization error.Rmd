## Mark's method

Unknowns are normalized to the mean ratio of standards and then converted to Fm using the Fm of the normalizing standard:

$$ R_{norm} = \frac{R_{sample}}{R_{std}}$$

$$Fm_{sample} = R_{sample}\cdot Fm_{std}$$

With error propagation in 2 steps:

$$ \sigma_{R_{norm}} = R_{norm} \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{sample}^2}{R_{sample}^2} + \frac{\sigma_{std}^2}{R_{std}^2}}$$



$$ \sigma_{Fm_{sample}} = Fm_{sample} \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{R_{norm}}^2}{R_{norm}^2} + \frac{\sigma_{Fm_{std}}^2}{Fm_{std}^2}} $$ 

## Normalize targets using mean of standards and propagate errors

Unknowns are normalized using the mean measured value of gas standards using this equation:

$$ Fm_{sample} = \frac{R_{sample}\cdot Fm_{std}}{R_{std}}$$

If the expected fraction modern ($Fm_{std}$) of the standard is taken as a measured value with an error, rather than a constant or assigned ratio, normalization errors are propagated using this equation:

$$ \sigma_{Fm_{sample}} = Fm_{sample} \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{sample}^2}{R_{sample}^2} + \frac{\sigma_{std}^2}{R_{std}^2} +
\frac{\sigma_{Fm_{std}}^2}{Fm_{std}^2}} $$
