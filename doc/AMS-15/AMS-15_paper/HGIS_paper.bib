	abstract = {An on-line measurement system was installed at the {MICADAS} in Zurich, using an elemental analyzer ({EA}) as a combustion unit to enable direct radiocarbon measurement of samples containing carbon in the range of 5–100 μg possible with minimum effort. The samples are combusted in small capsules and the gaseous combustion products are separated by the {EA}. The carbon dioxide leaving the {EA} in a high helium flow is concentrated on a small external trap containing X13 zeolite adsorber material. This new concept, avoiding a cryogenic trapping for the enrichment step, allows the construction of a very compact system able to work even with the smallest samples. Concentrated on the external trap, the carbon dioxide is flushed into the gas-tight syringe of our gas inlet system using a low helium stream. The gas mixture is measured with the {MICADAS} gas ion source. Several different sample capsules were analyzed to minimize the major blank contribution coming from the sample vessel. The best results were achieved with 25-μL tin capsules, which contained only 0.34 ± 0.13 μg carbon at 65 {pMC}. This work describes the development of the on-line system and the protocol for measurement runs. Results are presented for on-line measurements of reference materials and a comparison is performed with typical dating samples measured previously as graphite targets. Finally, relevance and limitations of on-line measurements are discussed.},

For samples containing 6 to 25 μg C, these reactors convert {CO} 2 to graphitic carbon in approximately 30 min. Although we continue to refine reaction conditions to improve yield, the reactors produce graphite targets that are successfully measured by {AMS}. Graphite targets produced with the ultra-small reactors are measured by using the Cs sputter source on the {CFAMS} instrument at {NOSAMS} where beam current was proportional to sample mass. We investigated the contribution of blank carbon from the ultra-small reactors and estimate it to be 0.3 ± 0.1 μg C with an Fm value of 0.43 ± 0.3. We also describe equations for blank correction and propagation of error associated with this correction. With a few exceptions for samples in the range of 6 to 7 μg C, we show that corrected Fm values agree with expected Fm values within uncertainty for samples containing 6–100 μg C.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a technique for measuring the 14C content of carbonate samples by producing C− ions directly in the negative ion sputter source of an accelerator mass spectrometer ({AMS}) system. This direct analysis of carbonate material eliminates the time and expense of graphite preparation. Powdered carbonate is mixed with titanium powder, loaded into a target cartridge, and compressed. Beam currents for optimally-sized carbonate targets (0.09–0.15 mg C) are typically 10–20\% of those produced by optimally-sized graphite targets (0.5–1 mg C). Modern ({\textgreater}0.8 Fm) samples run by this method have standard deviations of 0.009 Fm or less, and near-modern samples run as unknowns agree with values from traditional hydrolysis/graphite to better than 2\%. Targets with as little as 0.06 mg carbonate produce useable ion currents and results, albeit with increased error and larger blank. In its current state, direct sputtering is best applied to problems where a large number of analyses with lower precision are required. These applications could include age surveys of deep-sea corals for determination of historic population dynamics, to identify samples that would benefit from high precision analysis, and for growth rate studies of organisms forming carbonate skeletons.},

This secondary ionization target enables an accelerator mass spectrometer to ionize pulses of {CO}2 in the negative mode to measure 14C/12C isotopic ratios in real time. The design of the targets were based on computational flow dynamics, ionization mechanism and empirical optimization. As part of the ionization mechanism, the adsorption of {CO}2 on the Ti surface was fitted with the Jovanovic–Freundlich isotherm model using empirical and simulation data. The inferred adsorption constants were in good agreement with other works. The empirical optimization showed that amount of injected carbon and the flow speed of the helium carrier gas improve the ionization efficiency and the amount of 12C− produced until reaching a saturation point. Linear dynamic range between 150 and 1000 ng of C and optimum carrier gas flow speed of around 0.1 {mL}/min were shown. It was also shown that the ionization depends on the area of the Ti surface and Cs+ beam cross-section. A range of ionization efficiency of 1–2.5\% was obtained by optimizing the described parameters.},

	abstract = {A gas handling technique has been developed for metering {CO}2 into the gas ion source of the Erlangen {AMS} facility. Further investigations and developments have resulted in a system that enables the handling of gaseous samples with carbon masses from 1 ??g to 1 mg. The system has been optimized for coupling an elemental analyzer to a gas ion source. Moreover, the system can be connected to any other system that produces {CO}2, e.g. gas ampoules, gas chromatographs, etc. The principle of the gas handling system is to first store and isolate {CO}2 cryogenically. Then the {CO}2 is fed into the ion source by the pressure difference between the {CO}2 reservoir and the gas ion source which are connected by a glass capillary. By regulation of the {CO}2 pressure, the {CO}2 flow into the ion source can be controlled. The outstanding advantage of this easy technique is the possibility of its complete automation. For use of the system with an elemental analyzer we created application software that controls the combustion of the sample, the cryogenic storage and the exact metering of the {CO}2 into the ion source. Besides the application of using {CO}2 for radiocarbon dating, our gas handling system opens new possibilities of research in fields where only small samples are available or large series of samples have to be measured quickly, e.g. environmental or biomedical research. In addition this system has turned out to be a perfect tool for detailed investigations of gas ion sources. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Radiocarbon dating by means of accelerator mass spectrometry ({AMS}) is a well-established method for samples containing carbon in the milligram range. However, the measurement of small samples containing less than 50 ??g carbon often fails. It is difficult to graphitise these samples and the preparation is prone to contamination. To avoid graphitisation, a solution can be the direct measurement of carbon dioxide. The {MICADAS}, the smallest accelerator for radiocarbon dating in Zurich, is equipped with a hybrid Cs sputter ion source. It allows the measurement of both, graphite targets and gaseous {CO}2 samples, without any rebuilding. This work presents experiences dealing with small samples containing 1-40 ??g carbon. 500 unknown samples of different environmental research fields have been measured yet. Most of the samples were measured with the gas ion source. These data are compared with earlier measurements of small graphite samples. The performance of the two different techniques is discussed and main contributions to the blank determined. An analysis of blank and standard data measured within years allowed a quantification of the contamination, which was found to be of the order of 55 ng and 750 ng carbon (50 {pMC}) for the gaseous and the graphite samples, respectively. For quality control, a number of certified standards were measured using the gas ion source to demonstrate reliability of the data. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Significant effort was spent increasing the efficiency of C- ion beam extraction as well as the operational reliability. Details are described in Stolz et al. (2017). Recent work was aimed at prolonging the cleaning intervals and allowing unattended routine 14CO2 measurements. Problems related to sparking inside the source chamber could be eliminated by electrically shielding the ceramic linear actuator that is used to move the target pieces into the source head. Furthermore, the Cs reservoir temperature was decreased from 135 °C to 120 °C. The negative ion formation efficiency has dropped only slightly to about 5\% with the current settings. Additionally, the {GIS} sample magazine capacity was doubled to 16 ampules, which enables longer measurements without user interaction. A dedicated software (Gas Injection Control Software, {GICS}) was developed that controls {GIS} and {AMS} hardware for fully autonomous measurements, including the source and accelerator startup, sample cracking or combustion, sample mixing with the He carrier gas and the transfer to the source, as well as the subsequent data analysis. This tool also comprises error detection routines in order to minimize the risk of losing a sample due to hardware failures. The blank value was reduced from typically 7·10-15 to ∼3·10-15. This was achieved by modifications in the cleaning and measurement procedures. Recently a {EuroVector} {EA}3000 elemental analyzer ({EA}) was coupled to the {GIS} and integrated into the {GICS} software. First {EA} test measurements with standards, blanks and tree rings were performed as well as first automated overnight measurements with ampules and {EA} samples.},

New analytical advances using the {MIni} {CArbon} {DAting} System ({MICADAS}) allow 14C dating of very small samples, circumventing size limitations inherent to conventional 14C measurements with accelerator mass spectrometry ({AMS}). Here we use foraminiferal samples and carbonate standard material to assess the reproducibility and precision of {MICADAS} 14C analyses, quantify contamination biases, and determine foraminiferal 14C blank levels. The reproducibility of conventional 14C ages for our planktic (benthic) foraminiferal samples from gas measurements is 200 (130) yr, and has good precision as illustrated by the agreement between both standards and their reference values as well as between small gas- and larger graphitized foraminiferal samples (within 100±60 yr). We observe a constant contamination bias and slightly higher 14C blanks for foraminifera than for carbonate reference materials, limiting gas (graphite) 14C age determinations for foraminifera from our study sites to ∼38 (∼42) kyr. Our findings underline the significance of {MICADAS} gas analyses for 14C on smaller-than-conventional sized foraminiferal samples for paleoclimate reconstructions and dating.},

Such small samples are highly susceptible to contamination by extraneous carbon, which needs to be minimized and carefully accounted for in order to yield accurate results. Here, we undertook comprehensive characterization and quantification of contamination associated with molecular radiocarbon ( 14 C) {BPCA} analyses through systematic processing of multiple authentic standards with both fossil and modern 14 C signatures at various concentrations. Using this approach, we precisely apportion the contribution of extraneous carbon with respect to the four implemented subprocedures. Assuming a constant source and quantity of extraneous carbon we correct and statistically evaluate uncertainties in resulting 14 C data. Subsequently, we examine the results of triplicate analyses of reference materials representing four different environmental matrices (sediment, soil, aerosol, riverine natural organic matter) and apportion their {BPCA} sources in terms of carbon residues derived from biomass or fossil fuel combustion. This comprehensive approach to {CSRA} facilitates retrieval of robust 14 C data, with application in environmental studies of the continuum of pyrogenic carbon.},

Samples were placed in an in-house designed {LA}-cell, and {CO}2 gas was produced by ablation using a 193 nm {ArF} excimer laser. The 14C/12C abundance ratio of the gas was then analyzed by gas ion source {AMS}. This configuration allows flexible and time-resolved acquisition of 14C profiles in contrast to conventional measurements, where only the bulk composition of discrete samples can be obtained. Three different measurement modes, i.e. discrete layer analysis, survey scans, and precision scans, were investigated and compared using a stalagmite sample and, subsequently, applied to terrestrial and marine carbonates. Depending on the measurement mode, a precision of typically 1-5\% combined with a spatial resolution of 100 μm can be obtained. Prominent 14C features, such as the atomic bomb 14C peak, can be resolved by scanning several cm of a sample within 1 h. Stalagmite, deep-sea coral, and mollusk shell samples yielded comparable signal intensities, which again were comparable to those of conventional gas measurements. The novel {LA}-{AMS} setup allowed rapid scans on a variety of sample materials with high spatial resolution.},

Stable and reproducible C- currents up to 12 ??A can be achieved for an optimal {CO}2 gas flow rate of 1.5 ?? 0.5 ??l min-1, resulting in typical efficiency of 8\% from {CO}2 to C- and that of 5\% from {CO}2 to C4+. The precision is limited by the lifetime of the gas cathode, but measurements with modern materials have shown that a precision of better than 0.5\% and 1\% on {\textgreater}200 ??g C and 10-200 ??g C respectively is obtainable on a routine basis. The normalized 14C values for {TIRI} intercomparison sample A (Barley mash) agree well with the consensus value within the margin of uncertainty. The background comes from the gas cathode and probably cross contamination, which is estimated to be ca. 1 {pMC}. Large-sized samples (usually {\textgreater}200 ??g C) can readily be run as pure {CO}2 while samples as small as 40 ??g C can be measured at an optimal flow rate using helium carrier gas. Even smaller samples ({\textgreater}5 ??g C) have been analysed at a reduced current. At present, source poisoning effects at helium flow rates above 130 ??l min-1 limit the further reduction in measurable sample size. A manifold redesign is expected to address this problem. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Compound-specific radiocarbon (14C) dating often requires working with small samples of {\textless} 100 μg carbon (μ{gC}). This makes the radiocarbon dates of biomarker compounds very sensitive to biases caused by extraneous carbon of unknown composition, a procedural blank, which is introduced to the samples during the steps necessary to prepare a sample for radiocarbon analysis by accelerator mass spectrometry (i.e., isolating single compounds from a heterogeneous mixture, combustion, gas purification and graphitization). Reporting accurate radiocarbon dates thus requires a correction for the procedural blank. We present our approach to assess the fraction modern carbon (F14C) and the mass of the procedural blanks introduced during the preparation procedures of lipid biomarkers (i.e. n-alkanoic acids) and lignin phenols. We isolated differently sized aliquots (6–151 μ{gC}) of n-alkanoic acids and lignin phenols obtained from standard materials with known F14C values. Each compound class was extracted from two standard materials (one fossil, one modern) and purified using the same procedures as for natural samples of unknown F14C. There is an inverse linear relationship between the measured F14C values of the processed aliquots and their mass, which suggests constant contamination during processing of individual samples. We use Bayesian methods to fit linear regression lines between F14C and 1/mass for the fossil and modern standards. The intersection points of these lines are used to infer F14Cblank and mblank and their associated uncertainties. We estimate 4.88 ± 0.69 μ{gC} of procedural blank with F14C of 0.714 ± 0.077 for n-alkanoic acids, and 0.90 ± 0.23 μ{gC} of procedural blank with F14C of 0.813 ± 0.155 for lignin phenols. These F14Cblank and mblank can be used to correct {AMS} results of lipid and lignin samples by isotopic mass balance. This method may serve as a standardized procedure for blank assessment in small-scale radiocarbon analysis.},

In order to determine the precision, accuracy, and reproducibility of measurements on processed compounds, we explore the results of both reference materials and three classes of compounds (fatty acids, alkenones, and amino acids) extracted from sediment samples. We utilize a {MATLAB} code developed to systematically evaluate constant-contamination-model parameters, which in turn can be applied to measurements of unknown process samples. This approach is computationally reliable and can be used for any blank assessment of small-size radiocarbon samples. Our results show that a conservative lower estimate of the sample sizes required to produce relatively high-precision 14C data (i.e., with acceptable errors of {\textless}5\% on ﬁnal 14C ages) and high reproducibility in old samples (i.e., F14C ≈ 0.1) using current isolation methods are 50 and 30 μg of C for alkenones and fatty acids, respectively.

We report tests and developments performed over 3 years with a carbonate handling system ({CHS}) coupled to {AixMICADAS}. Gas source {AMS} measurements were performed after different pretreatments applied to various carbonate samples including blanks, reference materials, corals and foraminiferal samples ranging from about 5 μg to 100 μg of carbon. In parallel, the {CHS} coupled to the automated graphitization system ({AGE}3, {IonPlus} {AG}) was used to develop a similar leaching procedure for carbonates dated with solid targets. The {CHS}-{AGE}3 system can be used efficiently and precisely for samples larger than 300 μ{gC} and less precisely down to 100 μ{gC} by applying a constant contamination correction.},

Samples are encapsulated into vessels prior to combustion in the {EA}, which introduces extraneous C. The mass and fraction modern (F14C, i.e. the activity ratio of the sample relative to a modern reference material) of this constant contamination was characterized for various vessel materials and shapes. Different vessel cleaning procedures and storage effects were investigated. A minimum contamination mass of 0.10 ± 0.02 µg C per vessel was found for baked Al boats stored in {GC}-vials. Analysis of standard materials was then performed in order to assess contamination mass and fraction modern of the coupled setup. By applying the model of constant contamination, a mass of 0.44 ± 0.13 µg C and a F14C of 0.48 ± 0.14 were derived. Based on these findings, the mass-dependent detection limit ({MDL}) was calculated indicating that for a sample containing 5 µg C the F14C has to be superior to 0.03 to make it distinguishable from the background level. Finally, ultrasmall samples of three certified reference materials ({IAEA} C5, C6, C7) were analyzed and corrected according to the model of constant contamination.
