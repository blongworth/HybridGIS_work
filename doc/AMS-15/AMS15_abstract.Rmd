We have developed a method for radiocarbon measurement of carbonate minerals as CO~2~ gas via a hybrid sputter gas ion source. Our method uses a carrier gas to displace CO~2~ from sample vials to an open split, where a capillary samples the mixture for delivery directly to a hybrid sputter gas ion source (HGIS). This method skips the gas transfer and quantification steps used in a closed inlet HGIS system, simplifying sample measurement. Results from measurements of consensus standards and samples from a marine core show that the method agrees well with traditional AMS measurement of the same samples, and that the method error is less than 1.5%. We discuss advantanges and disadvantanges of continuous flow sample introduction.
