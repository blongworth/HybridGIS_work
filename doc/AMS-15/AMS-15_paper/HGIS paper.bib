	abstract = {The radiocarbon analysis laboratory at Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) is equipped with an accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) MICADAS (MIni CArbon Dating System). The laboratory provides routine 14C analyses on bulk organic matter, plant fragments, dissolved and particulate organic matter, individual molecular lipids, and carbonate (micro-) fossils with the aim to foster international research efforts in vulnerable high latitudes. The AWI MICADAS allows AMS 14C analysis on graphite targets as well as on CO2 samples via gas injection into the hybrid ion source. The laboratory thus provides reliable datasets even if only small amounts of sample material are available, a problem often encountered in polar research. Here we describe the standard operation procedures and sample preparation methods employed, and demonstrate the instrument performance and data quality based on repeat analysis of international reference materials.},

	abstract = {A fully automatic continuous-flow gas injection interface was built to couple an elemental analyzer with a MICADAS accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) as a low-cost option that does not require an absorber trap for CO2 injection. The complication of the variable ion current during gas injection can be overcome by understanding and controlling the mass flow-dependent ionization yield. The time-varying CO2 concentrations and carbon mass flows are estimated with a mathematical model in order to investigate their relationship with the abundant isotope (12C–) signal. This model is based on a complete CO2 diffusion equation and instantaneous mass flow. It shows a good agreement between model calculations and the measurements. A reversible suppression of the formation of ions occurs, if the carbon mass flow exceeds 2.0–2.3 μg C/min. This result repeats for different injection capillaries and for different carrier volumetric flow rates.},

We tested both systems with multiple series of 14C-free and modern standards (2.5–50 μg C) combusted in quartz ampoules or EA containers and were able to quantify exogenous C introduced. In EA-GIS-AMS analysis exogenous C is mainly derived from the EA sample containers. Blank values for 50 μg C combusted in solvent-cleaned tin (Sn) vessels were 0.0127 ± 0.0012 F14C (boats) and 0.0090 ± 0.0010 F14C (capsules), while they were much higher for thermally cleaned silver (Ag) capsules. The processing of gas samples for GIS-AMS yields similar blank values corresponding to 0.30 ± 0.08 μg exogenous C with 0.93 ± 0.23 F14C consisting of 0.28 μg C modern and 0.02 μg C fossil C. The combustion of larger amounts of blank material (1 mg C) in a single quartz tube split into aliquots gives lower blanks (0.0064 ± 0.0008 F14C; 50 μg C). Thus, 14C analysis of small, gaseous samples is now possible at CologneAMS.},

	abstract = {Compound-specific radiocarbon (14C) dating often requires working with small samples of {\textless} 100 μg carbon (μgC). This makes the radiocarbon dates of biomarker compounds very sensitive to biases caused by extraneous carbon of unknown composition, a procedural blank, which is introduced to the samples during the steps necessary to prepare a sample for radiocarbon analysis by accelerator mass spectrometry (i.e., isolating single compounds from a heterogeneous mixture, combustion, gas purification and graphitization). Reporting accurate radiocarbon dates thus requires a correction for the procedural blank. We present our approach to assess the fraction modern carbon (F14C) and the mass of the procedural blanks introduced during the preparation procedures of lipid biomarkers (i.e. n-alkanoic acids) and lignin phenols. We isolated differently sized aliquots (6–151 μgC) of n-alkanoic acids and lignin phenols obtained from standard materials with known F14C values. Each compound class was extracted from two standard materials (one fossil, one modern) and purified using the same procedures as for natural samples of unknown F14C. There is an inverse linear relationship between the measured F14C values of the processed aliquots and their mass, which suggests constant contamination during processing of individual samples. We use Bayesian methods to fit linear regression lines between F14C and 1/mass for the fossil and modern standards. The intersection points of these lines are used to infer F14Cblank and mblank and their associated uncertainties. We estimate 4.88 ± 0.69 μgC of procedural blank with F14C of 0.714 ± 0.077 for n-alkanoic acids, and 0.90 ± 0.23 μgC of procedural blank with F14C of 0.813 ± 0.155 for lignin phenols. These F14Cblank and mblank can be used to correct AMS results of lipid and lignin samples by isotopic mass balance. This method may serve as a standardized procedure for blank assessment in small-scale radiocarbon analysis.},

	abstract = {Radiocarbon dating by means of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is a well-established method for samples containing carbon in the milligram range. However, the measurement of small samples containing less than 50 ??g carbon often fails. It is difficult to graphitise these samples and the preparation is prone to contamination. To avoid graphitisation, a solution can be the direct measurement of carbon dioxide. The MICADAS, the smallest accelerator for radiocarbon dating in Zurich, is equipped with a hybrid Cs sputter ion source. It allows the measurement of both, graphite targets and gaseous CO2 samples, without any rebuilding. This work presents experiences dealing with small samples containing 1-40 ??g carbon. 500 unknown samples of different environmental research fields have been measured yet. Most of the samples were measured with the gas ion source. These data are compared with earlier measurements of small graphite samples. The performance of the two different techniques is discussed and main contributions to the blank determined. An analysis of blank and standard data measured within years allowed a quantification of the contamination, which was found to be of the order of 55 ng and 750 ng carbon (50 pMC) for the gaseous and the graphite samples, respectively. For quality control, a number of certified standards were measured using the gas ion source to demonstrate reliability of the data. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A gas feeding system has been set up that enables constant dosing of CO2 into the Cs sputter ion source and ensures stable measuring conditions. The system is based on a syringe in which CO2 gas is mixed with He and then pressed continuously into the ion source at a constant flow rate. Minimized volumes allow feeding samples of 3–30 μg carbon quantitatively into the ion source. In order to test the performance of the system, several standards and blanks have successfully been measured.

	abstract = {An on-line measurement system was installed at the MICADAS in Zurich, using an elemental analyzer (EA) as a combustion unit to enable direct radiocarbon measurement of samples containing carbon in the range of 5–100 μg possible with minimum effort. The samples are combusted in small capsules and the gaseous combustion products are separated by the EA. The carbon dioxide leaving the EA in a high helium flow is concentrated on a small external trap containing X13 zeolite adsorber material. This new concept, avoiding a cryogenic trapping for the enrichment step, allows the construction of a very compact system able to work even with the smallest samples. Concentrated on the external trap, the carbon dioxide is flushed into the gas-tight syringe of our gas inlet system using a low helium stream. The gas mixture is measured with the MICADAS gas ion source. Several different sample capsules were analyzed to minimize the major blank contribution coming from the sample vessel. The best results were achieved with 25-μL tin capsules, which contained only 0.34 ± 0.13 μg carbon at 65 pMC. This work describes the development of the on-line system and the protocol for measurement runs. Results are presented for on-line measurements of reference materials and a comparison is performed with typical dating samples measured previously as graphite targets. Finally, relevance and limitations of on-line measurements are discussed.},

This direct analysis of carbonate material eliminates the time and expense of graphite preparation. Powdered carbonate is mixed with titanium powder, loaded into a target cartridge, and compressed. Beam currents for optimally-sized carbonate targets (0.09–0.15 mg C) are typically 10–20\% of those produced by optimally-sized graphite targets (0.5–1 mg C). Modern ({\textgreater}0.8 Fm) samples run by this method have standard deviations of 0.009 Fm or less, and near-modern samples run as unknowns agree with values from traditional hydrolysis/graphite to better than 2\%. Targets with as little as 0.06 mg carbonate produce useable ion currents and results, albeit with increased error and larger blank. In its current state, direct sputtering is best applied to problems where a large number of analyses with lower precision are required. These applications could include age surveys of deep-sea corals for determination of historic population dynamics, to identify samples that would benefit from high precision analysis, and for growth rate studies of organisms forming carbonate skeletons.},

Stable and reproducible C- currents up to 12 ??A can be achieved for an optimal CO2 gas flow rate of 1.5 ?? 0.5 ??l min-1, resulting in typical efficiency of 8\% from CO2 to C- and that of 5\% from CO2 to C4+. The precision is limited by the lifetime of the gas cathode, but measurements with modern materials have shown that a precision of better than 0.5\% and 1\% on {\textgreater}200 ??g C and 10-200 ??g C respectively is obtainable on a routine basis. The normalized 14C values for TIRI intercomparison sample A (Barley mash) agree well with the consensus value within the margin of uncertainty. The background comes from the gas cathode and probably cross contamination, which is estimated to be ca. 1 pMC. Large-sized samples (usually {\textgreater}200 ??g C) can readily be run as pure CO2 while samples as small as 40 ??g C can be measured at an optimal flow rate using helium carrier gas. Even smaller samples ({\textgreater}5 ??g C) have been analysed at a reduced current.

	abstract = {A new instrumental setup, combining laser ablation (LA) with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), has been investigated for the online radiocarbon (14C) analysis of carbonate records. Samples were placed in an in-house designed LA-cell, and CO2 gas was produced by ablation using a 193 nm ArF excimer laser. The 14C/12C abundance ratio of the gas was then analyzed by gas ion source AMS. This configuration allows flexible and time-resolved acquisition of 14C profiles in contrast to conventional measurements, where only the bulk composition of discrete samples can be obtained. Three different measurement modes, i.e. discrete layer analysis, survey scans, and precision scans, were investigated and compared using a stalagmite sample and, subsequently, applied to terrestrial and marine carbonates. Depending on the measurement mode, a precision of typically 1-5\% combined with a spatial resolution of 100 μm can be obtained. Prominent 14C features, such as the atomic bomb 14C peak, can be resolved by scanning several cm of a sample within 1 h. Stalagmite, deep-sea coral, and mollusk shell samples yielded comparable signal intensities, which again were comparable to those of conventional gas measurements. The novel LA-AMS setup allowed rapid scans on a variety of sample materials with high spatial resolution.},

	abstract = {A gas handling technique has been developed for metering CO2 into the gas ion source of the Erlangen AMS facility. Further investigations and developments have resulted in a system that enables the handling of gaseous samples with carbon masses from 1 ??g to 1 mg. The system has been optimized for coupling an elemental analyzer to a gas ion source. Moreover, the system can be connected to any other system that produces CO2, e.g. gas ampoules, gas chromatographs, etc. The principle of the gas handling system is to first store and isolate CO2 cryogenically. Then the CO2 is fed into the ion source by the pressure difference between the CO2 reservoir and the gas ion source which are connected by a glass capillary. By regulation of the CO2 pressure, the CO2 flow into the ion source can be controlled. The outstanding advantage of this easy technique is the possibility of its complete automation. For use of the system with an elemental analyzer we created application software that controls the combustion of the sample, the cryogenic storage and the exact metering of the CO2 into the ion source. Besides the application of using CO2 for radiocarbon dating, our gas handling system opens new possibilities of research in fields where only small samples are available or large series of samples have to be measured quickly, e.g. environmental or biomedical research. In addition this system has turned out to be a perfect tool for detailed investigations of gas ion sources. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Since 2015, the CologneAMS started operating a second SO-110 B ion source (Arnold et al., 2010; Klein and Mous, 2017) from High Voltage Engineering Europe (HVE) with a gas injection system (GIS) from Ionplus AG (Wacker et al., 2013) for the measurement of gaseous CO2 samples. Significant effort was spent increasing the efficiency of C- ion beam extraction as well as the operational reliability. Details are described in Stolz et al. (2017). Recent work was aimed at prolonging the cleaning intervals and allowing unattended routine 14CO2 measurements. Problems related to sparking inside the source chamber could be eliminated by electrically shielding the ceramic linear actuator that is used to move the target pieces into the source head. Furthermore, the Cs reservoir temperature was decreased from 135 °C to 120 °C. The negative ion formation efficiency has dropped only slightly to about 5\% with the current settings. Additionally, the GIS sample magazine capacity was doubled to 16 ampules, which enables longer measurements without user interaction. A dedicated software (Gas Injection Control Software, GICS) was developed that controls GIS and AMS hardware for fully autonomous measurements, including the source and accelerator startup, sample cracking or combustion, sample mixing with the He carrier gas and the transfer to the source, as well as the subsequent data analysis. This tool also comprises error detection routines in order to minimize the risk of losing a sample due to hardware failures. The blank value was reduced from typically 7·10-15 to ∼3·10-15. This was achieved by modifications in the cleaning and measurement procedures. Recently a EuroVector EA3000 elemental analyzer (EA) was coupled to the GIS and integrated into the GICS software. First EA test measurements with standards, blanks and tree rings were performed as well as first automated overnight measurements with ampules and EA samples.},

	abstract = {Radiocarbon (14C) measurements of foraminifera often provide the only absolute age constraints in marine sediments. However, they are often challenging as their reliability and accuracy can be compromised by reduced availability of adequate sample material. New analytical advances using the MIni CArbon DAting System (MICADAS) allow 14C dating of very small samples, circumventing size limitations inherent to conventional 14C measurements with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Here we use foraminiferal samples and carbonate standard material to assess the reproducibility and precision of MICADAS 14C analyses, quantify contamination biases, and determine foraminiferal 14C blank levels. The reproducibility of conventional 14C ages for our planktic (benthic) foraminiferal samples from gas measurements is 200 (130) yr, and has good precision as illustrated by the agreement between both standards and their reference values as well as between small gas- and larger graphitized foraminiferal samples (within 100±60 yr). We observe a constant contamination bias and slightly higher 14C blanks for foraminifera than for carbonate reference materials, limiting gas (graphite) 14C age determinations for foraminifera from our study sites to ∼38 (∼42) kyr. Our findings underline the significance of MICADAS gas analyses for 14C on smaller-than-conventional sized foraminiferal samples for paleoclimate reconstructions and dating.},

	abstract = {The coupling of an elemental analyzer (EA) to the gas ion source of an accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) allows to perform online radiocarbon (14C) analysis of small combustible samples. EA-AMS measurements of small and ultra-small samples containing carbon in the range of 5–100 µg are performed on a routine basis at the MICADAS at ETH Zurich. Samples are encapsulated into vessels prior to combustion in the EA, which introduces extraneous C. The mass and fraction modern (F14C, i.e. the activity ratio of the sample relative to a modern reference material) of this constant contamination was characterized for various vessel materials and shapes. Different vessel cleaning procedures and storage effects were investigated. A minimum contamination mass of 0.10 ± 0.02 µg C per vessel was found for baked Al boats stored in GC-vials. Analysis of standard materials was then performed in order to assess contamination mass and fraction modern of the coupled setup. By applying the model of constant contamination, a mass of 0.44 ± 0.13 µg C and a F14C of 0.48 ± 0.14 were derived. Based on these findings, the mass-dependent detection limit (MDL) was calculated indicating that for a sample containing 5 µg C the F14C has to be superior to 0.03 to make it distinguishable from the background level. Finally, ultrasmall samples of three certified reference materials (IAEA C5, C6, C7) were analyzed and corrected according to the model of constant contamination. For all three materials the corrected data was in agreement with the nominal values within the uncertainties.},
